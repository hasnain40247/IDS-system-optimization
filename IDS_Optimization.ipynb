    "# Training an Intrusion Detection System with KDD99\n",
    "\n",
    "The [KDD-99 dataset](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) is very famous in the security field and almost a \"hello world\" of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in machine learning. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is program that monitors computers and network systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any intrusion activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally. IDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks. Although KDD99 dataset is over 20 years old, it is still widely used to demonstrate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). KDD99 is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between \"bad\" connections, called intrusions or attacks, and \"good\" normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, including a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following code reads the KDD99 CSV dataset into a Pandas data frame. The standard format of KDD99 does not include column names. Because of that, the program adds them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this step we select and discover the data that was processed and will be used to train our machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dataset consists of a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment. It has 494021 rows & 42 columns.\n",

    "The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the genetic algorithm selects individuals from the current population to be parents and uses them to produce the children for the next generation. Over successive generations, the population \"evolves\" toward an optimal solution. This algorithm can be used for a variety of optimization problems, and hence we also attempt to optimize our Intrusion Detection System using this."
